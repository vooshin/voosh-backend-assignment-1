# Enhanced Music Library Management API

## Overview

In this assignment, you will develop a **Music Library Management API** that allows users within an organization to manage their collection of **Artists**, **Tracks**, and **Albums**. Each organization has a single Admin who oversees the system and its users. The API also provides functionality for users to mark their favorite Artists, Albums, and Tracks for quick access and personalization.

> ### Key Points:
>
> - **One Organization, One Admin**: Each organization has a single Admin with full control over the system.
> - **Role-Based Access Control**: Users have distinct roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), with permissions tailored to their responsibilities.
> - **Entity Relationships**: Albums belong to Artists, and Tracks are associated with Albums and Artists.
> - **Favorites**: Users can personalize their experience by marking items as favorites for easy retrieval.

## Your Task

Your task is to develop a RESTful API that allows users to manage their music library. The API should support the features listed below. Ensure you follow best practices for API development, including proper **status codes**, **error handling**, and **response payloads**.

## Evaluation Criteria

- API correctness: Ensure all 25(0 to 24) endpoints function as expected with proper request and response handling.
- Code structure and cleanliness.
- Error handling and status code implementation.
- Adherence to best practices in RESTful API design.
- Use Node.js for the backend and any database of your choice.

## Submission

- Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code to it.
- Deploy your API to a hosting service (e.g. Render Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Render is a free hosting service which you can use to deploy your API https://render.com/docs/free
- Submit the repository link and the hosted API URL/Hosted URL(baseUrl).
- Make sure you proved your hosted URL(baseUrl) in the submission based on that we will check the endpoints; example: base-url:`https://your-hosted-url/` or base-url:`https://your-hosted-url/api/v1`
- Based on the base-url we will check the endpoints, Base-url/logout, Base-url/signup, base-url/users, etc.
- API responses must be in **JSON format**.
- For **GET requests**, ensure the response structure matches the examples provided.
- use same endpoint as below

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement **authentication** and **role-based access control** using a method of your choice.
- **Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Full CRUD operations on all entities, including user management.
  - **Editor**: Can edit and delete Artists, Albums, Tracks, and their own details (e.g., updating their password).
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to all entities.
- The first user registered in the system automatically becomes an **Admin**.

### Entity Management

1. **Users**:  
   Admins can manage users by adding, deleting, and updating their roles (except for other Admins).
2. **Artists, Albums, Tracks**:  
   Full CRUD operations based on role permissions.
3. **Favorites**:  
   Users can add or remove their favorite Artists, Albums, and Tracks.
